# SMS Spam Detection

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview
This project is a machine learning-based solution for detecting spam messages in SMS. It uses the Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms to classify messages as either **spam** or **ham** (not spam).

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `data/spam_ham_dataset.csv` - The dataset used for training and testing the models.
- `notebooks/SMS_spam_detection.ipynb` - The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt` - The Python dependencies required to run the project.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Preprocessing of SMS messages.
- Implementation of Naive Bayes and KNN models using `sklearn`.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset), containing labeled SMS messages as either **spam** or **ham**.

## ðŸ”§ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JanaviN7/SMS-spam-detection.git
   cd SMS-spam-detection
